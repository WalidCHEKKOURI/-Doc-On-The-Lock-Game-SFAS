This is a project that was intended to showcase my programming skills in the 2021 SFAS game programming competition.

Inspired by the global pandemic, I created this game to convey the struggle that the doctors faced while making sure to progress the research in order to find a vaccine. Itâ€™s also a tribute to those unsung heroes who put their lives in danger for us to be safe.

The game takes place inside a maze (symbolizes the maze of uncertainty and loss). Unknown danger can be leaking around the corners and how the doctors need to be aware of their surrounding 24/7.

**Gameplay Mechanics:**

The game camera is the character's phone front camera, which displays information regarding the doctor's temperature, battery capacity and total collected data.

**Game Controls:**

Use AWSD for movement.

Use C key to collect data when near an infected (aka Caliriptus), data needs to be collected of both the front and back profile of the the infected (Caliriptus).

Use Spacebar key to distract the Caliriptus (Tip: to collect the back profile photo you can either stealthy come behind him or you can distract him and when his back is turned you can hit the C key to collect the back profile data).

To change the phone camera location you can use the left and right keyboard inputs.

The movement is different in this game since the phone camera is your main camera, so your directions are different from the character's directions (it's a nice neurological challenge for you when you play).
  
HAVE FUN!
